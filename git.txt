git clone - Click on clone and choose from an existing repo on github like this one that I cloned.
so you can create a branch by typing ctrl + shift + p and go to git create new branch and publish using cloud icon on the branch 
stage changes using ctrl + shift + p and staging the changes then use commit with a message and then push using the up-arrow icon 
in commits section.
Okay so till now 

I've made a -- 
--> new branch 
--> staged changes 
--> committed em and 
--> pushed em to a separate branch 
--> Stashed changes using git stash (it temporarily saves your changes and then you can switch branch work on other branch and then again pop 
stash to get your changes on this branch)
